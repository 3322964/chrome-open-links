# Open Selected Links (Chrome Extension)

This [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome) Extension allows you to open all links within a selected area on a website.

## Features

* Open all links within a selection as new tabs
* Usage via context menu â€“ no annoying icon in chrome bar :)
* Filter links for images, videos or audio
* See the first 10 link urls
* Finds html links as well as plain urls

## How to use

Install the extension from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/open-selected-links/cbmiafnaglmnkhnohfdkdgaohdhndkjp). After installation make sure to restart Chrome or reload the current websites. 

Select some part of a webpage that contains links. Right click and choose 'Open selected links' -> 'All' from the context menu. They will now open to the right of your current tab.

The context menu shows you already how many pages will be opened. It also shows the first 10 urls.
